# Awesome Research Software Registries [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of research software registries (also known as catalog, index, warehouse,
repository, hub, platform, and other terms).

We define a registry as any publicly accessible website where research software
can be registered, and that employs Search Engine Optimization such as the
addition of metadata to help promote discovery of the research software that is
published on the registry. Websites do not necessarily have to retain their own
copies of the research software itself in order to be included in the list
below.
